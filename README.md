# ProLanDle

ProLanDle (abbr. for rogramming-Language-dle) is an interactive web application that emulates the popular game Wordle but with a unique twist tailored for programming enthusiasts.
In ProLanDle, users are challenged to guess the name of a programming language.
Each guess provides feedback, guiding the player towards the correct answer through a process of elimination and logical deduction.
